# Flaschard-O-Matic
## Discover the flashcard difference

Everyone, at some point in their life, has used flashcards before. They are great for studying, but what's the problem with them?
You have to go to the store and buy the cards and a marker. Some of the cards end up being lost or destroyed, and they are a pain to
try and keep track of. With everything else in life becoming more digital, I felt the need to create an app that would allow us to study,
using only a computer.

## Features
- *Study*: allows the user to study the cards from a specified deck
- *Create deck*: allows the user to create a new deck
- *Edit deck*: allows the user to modify information on an existing deck
- *Add card*: allows the user to add a new card to an existing deck
- *Edit card*: allows the user to modify information on an existing card

## Technology
### Built with React. Used the following React features:
- useState
- useEffect
- React-router-dom
- Event listeners (mainly click and submission handlers)

### Bootstrap
- Buttons
- Forms
- Cards

### An API server, powered by [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)

## Discoveries
Discovered the wonderful world of React. React makes complex apps much easier than having to modify the DOM itself.
After creating this project, I became much more comfortable with components, routes, and event handlers.

## Future Goals
Create more boilerplate decks, so that students have more ideas on what subjects to study. Would also like to add
a bit more styling using Bootstrap.
